# TGMS Journal Filter
A simple script to generate a list of class F, G, and K mainstars scanned in Elite: Dangerous journal files in the current directory. This list should only be submitted as Trans-Galactic Metallicity Survey data if you have scanned the nearest gas giant in every F/G/K system you have passed through, unless the system contained no gas giants.

With the end of Distant Worlds 2, this script no longer has any use and is published here for historical purposes.
